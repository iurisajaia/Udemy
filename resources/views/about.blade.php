                            <p> Hello! If you are reading this,  you are looking for free online courses and you got here. 
                                FreeOnlineCourses.me is a website, where you can find and download desired courses. </p>
                                <p>I am a programmer which means I’m constantly searching for the most up-to-date courses to learn more and  
                                    keep up with the newest trends of coding world but as many of you knows downloading a free course is 
                                    an endless chain of steps:  you need to turn off the adblocker from your browser then click a link, wait 
                                    for 10 seconds then verify through the google reCAPTCHA,  wait again and so on..</p>
                                    <p>  This inconvenience pushed 
                                    me to come up with an idea of creating a platform where I’d upload the same courses and everybody would be 
                                    able to download with just a click.  </p>
                
                                    <p>
                                    We’re always trying to suggest courses of high quality. If you can not find desired file on our 
                                    platform, please don’t hesitate to ask and we’ll try to add the course shortly. </p>
